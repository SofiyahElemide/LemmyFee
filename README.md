  I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Ilorin and I am best known for my communication, analytical thinking, organizational and problem-solving skills.

  One of my major achievements is that I have become an innovative Data Analyst well-versed in using tools to collect data from both primary and secondary sources.  My expertise in Python, its libraries(Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), and SQL allows me to utilize sophisticated statistical analysis, data mining, and data visualization approaches to find trends and generate insights that may have an impact on corporate performance. I am able to explore datasets using practical and critical thinking to find subtle patterns due to my data-wrangling abilities.

  Another big achievement was that I was one of the 100 corp members given the opportunity to complete a Venture in Management Programme(ViMP) sponsored by Junior Achievers Nigeria(JAN) and hosted by Lagos Business School. The program exposed me to various aspects of leadership and business management and strategy which I can confidently say has improved my critical thinking and decision-making skills. 
    I am very passionate about how the use of technology in various business industries can make the world a better place for the present and future generations.
